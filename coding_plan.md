# Done
X. Select datasets, download them, comment on format, number etc.

# To Do
2. Choose model structures, implement and comment on the details
3. Implement the training of the models including the accuracy step version saving, comment on the details
	- Optimize the saving, model versions should not alway be trained from scratch
4. Select explanation methods, implement them and comment on the details (how to use, prerequisites for usage, etc.)
5. Select evaluation methods, implement (if necessary, look into how to use the quantus library: https://github.com/understandable-machine-intelligence-lab/Quantus) and again comment on the details
6. If necessary, adjust the modeltraining such that ideally all explanation methods and evaluation metrics can be applied
7. Implement the experimental setup including saving of the results, make a sketch of the savingstructure before starting to implement
8. Develop the method for analysis of the result, implement it for automatization
9. Start the experiments, save the generated data and analyse it
10. Compare results with your hypothesis, reflect on experience with the experimental setup, adjust, and start the planning for the ImageNet experiments
11. Celebrate to have finished your first own scienctific experiment with something tasty
